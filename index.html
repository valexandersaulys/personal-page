        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Currently living in New York City. Authorized to work anywhere in the United States
          and European Union. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Interested in building Software products -- not libraries, not scripts. That includes
          line-of-service internal software as well as applications touched by end users extenal
          to the company.
        </p>        
        <p>
          I've worked in a
          professional capacity in C++, Python, and Javascript. I have extensive experience in
          Docker, cloud compute environments, microservices, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Love things that "just work", which means <em>test - test - test</em> to ensure
          robustness so one can deploy with confidence. That means having a tight
          feedback loop with stakeholders to ensure requirements are met, being able to move quickly
          so adjustments can be made, and working within sometimes vague and ambiguous constraints. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Believer in moving quickly (but not breaking things!), which means having a tight <em>write -
          build - test</em> loop.
          That includes using docker to tightly containerize an application for portability between
          your local development and deployment. Doing so also forces you to
          explicitly state your requirements and decouples you from whatever OS you originally built
          on. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Never picky about technology. If its an old C++ application, I'll dust off the Strousoup
          books and get my hands dirty. Getting things done is what matters. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Strong belief in the importance of documentation. Others should know what you built and
          be able to pick up at a moment's notice without issue. Writing forces you to think through
          what you did and what you will do so you're not wasting time flailing in the wrong
          direction.
